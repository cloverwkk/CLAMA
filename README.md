# Reframing Unsupervised Machine Fault Detection as Cross-Modal Alignment via CLIP with Anomaly-Aware Contrastive Loss
This is the official project repository for the papaer "Unsupervised Machinery Fault Detection via CLIP with Anomaly-Aware Contrastive Learning and Sharpness-aware Minimization" by Kangkai Wu , Jingjing Li, Ke Lu (submitted to ICASSP2026).

Abstract:Unsupervised machine fault detection is hindered by scarce fault data and the mismatch between synthetic and real anomalies. We reformulate fault detection as a cross-modal alignment problem and propose a CLIP-based framework that aligns vibration-signal images with textual state descriptions. To overcome the lack of fault data, we construct physically interpretable pseudo-faults through amplitude scaling and interval perturbations on raw signals, enabling label-free imageâ€“text training. We further introduce an Anomaly-Aware Contrastive Loss (AACL) that enforces inter-class separation while preserving cross-modal alignment, and adopt Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) to mitigate overfitting to pseudo-fault artifacts and improve robustness. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches.
